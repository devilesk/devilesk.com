A comprehensive guide presented in a way such that anyone can learn Dota 2. This guide covers almost everything from top to bottom. Earlier content is targeted towards complete beginners, but intermediate players can still find the later information useful. 
		Sections are organized so that new players can look over only what is necessary to start playing and skip over more advanced concepts that can be looked at later. 
		There's also plenty of pictures, links to the Dota 2 wiki, and videos throughout the guide for further reading and viewing.
