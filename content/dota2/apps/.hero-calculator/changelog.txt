- Fixed bug where leveling up Keeper of the Light ultimate spent 3 skill points instead of 1.
- Calculations now allow for Eul's speed bonus to stack to match the fact that they stack in-game.
- Rather than reset all your skill points when you decrease your hero level, it will now just take away skill points based on which abilities you levelled last.
