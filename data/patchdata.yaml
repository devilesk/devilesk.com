          the snowball's path will be stunned and take damage. Each allied Hero in

      - note: You can now load an ally into your snowball within 400 range by right
          clicking on them
      - note: Snowball moves 75 MS faster for each allied hero inside it

      notes:
      - detail: []
        note: A few abilities and damage type mechanics have been reworked. There
          are now three primary damage types and a Spell Immunity Piercing status
          with each. Each ability now carries a notation in the tooltip indicating
          these.
      - detail: []
        note: The three damage types are Physical, Magical and Pure.
      - detail: []
        note: Physical is affected by Physical Armor, Magical is affected by Magical
          Damage Resistance and Pure is affected by neither.
      - detail: []
        note: Magic Immunity has now been renamed to Spell Immunity. Spell Immunity
          only defines if Spells interact with it, not how damage itself is handled.
          This means that on its own Spell Immunity status does not reduce any damage.
      - detail: []
        note: Black King Bar, Repel, Rage and all other previous forms of "Magic Immunity"
          now grant Spell Immunity status and a 100% Magic Resistance bonus.
      - detail: []
        note: In the vast majority of cases, the interactions are still the same,
          however an example of a case that would be different is if an ability has
          both Spell Immunity exception and has Pure damage type. Previously the damage
          would not have any impact, however now it does.
      - detail: []
        note: 'Ability Tooltips now have these fields:'
      - detail: []
        note: '-Damage Type: Physical/Magical/Pure'
      - detail: []
        note: '-Pierces Spell Immunity: Yes/No'
      - detail: []
        note: If the Damage Type is not Magical it will be colored differently to
          make it easier to notice. The same is true in cases where Pierces Spell
          Immunity is Yes.
      - detail: []
        note: There have been a few abilities rebalanced with these mechanics in mind.
          In some cases the intent is to maintain similar balance, in other cases
          as an adjustment to their balance.

        note: '2) HP Removal: This is no longer considered a Damage Type, and its
          remaining uses are as an alternative cost to Mana for spells to use (Sunray,
          Burning Spears) or as functional HP modifications (Armlet, Sunder, etc).
          These are now considered usage costs in the game and are never lethal.'

        note: AoE Bonus Gold component based on Team Net Worth difference reduced

      - detail: []
        note: AoE Bonus XP component based on Team XP difference reduced by 40%
      - detail: []
        note: Melee lane creep bounty reduced from 43 to 40 (-7%)
      - detail: []
        note: Range lane creep bounty reduced from 48 to 45 (-6.25%)
      - detail: []
        note: Hero kills (the non-net worth portions) are worth 10% more
      - detail:
        - If you are the only person contributing to a kill, you still get the same
          gold overall
        note: Reduced the direct hero last hit bounty by 100 and redistributed that
          gold into AoE gold (in ratio of 100/75/40/25/20 for 1/2/3/4/5 heroes)
      - detail:
        - 'Example: If 3 heroes kill an enemy hero, and the extra AoE bounty would
          normally be 200 gold for each player, it is instead 200+25% for the poorest
          hero, 200 for the middle, and 200-25% for the richest'
        note: AoE Bonus Gold is now distributed based on the relative net worth amongst
          the heroes involved in killing the hero by +/- 25%
      - detail:
        - 'Example: If the total AoE gold would normally have been 600, if the hero
          dying is the lowest in net worth, the bounty is reduced by 20% giving only
          480. If the dying hero is the highest, it is increased by 20%, giving 720'
        note: "The amount of AoE Bonus Gold given is now increased/decreased by up\
          \ to 20% based on the dying hero\u2019s relative rank in net worth amongst\
          \ all the enemies on that team."
      - detail:
        - This means that if you buyback when the enemy is pushing and you get a few
          kills, the amount of gold you get for that, including the networth difference
          bonus, is reduced by 60%
        note: Instead of Buyback temporarily preventing unreliable gold gain, it now
          reduces all gold gained (including hero and aoe gold) by 60%
      - detail: []
        note: Melee Barracks team bounty increased from 175 to 275

      - detail:
        - This means that you will get an extra melee creep at 15 minutes instead
          of at 17:30
        note: Extra melee creeps additions spawn time changed from 17:30/34:00/50:30
          to 15:00/30:00/45:00

          they die (they have 30% of the original units' health and damage, and only
          live for 60 seconds)
        - Mud Golems movement speed increased from 270 to 310
        - 'Mud Golems (and also Shard Golems) have a new active ability: Hurl Boulder
          (0.6 second stun, 125 damage, 30 cooldown, 800 range). They do not automatically
          cast this'
        - Gold/XP bounties rescaled so the total value for the camp remains the same
          (Mud Golems 32/42 Gold/XP each, Shard Golems 13/23 each)
        note: 'Reworked Mud Golems:'
      - detail: []
        note: Hero kills achieved by units under your control now provide XP credit
          to your hero (Affects things like Spirit Bear, Golems, Familiars, etc getting

        - 'Note: This does not mean that all these spells fully affect Neutral Ancients.
          It still depends on the units with Ancient tag being Spell Immune or not.
          It primarily means that those spells have no specific rule around the Ancient
          flag itself'
        note: 'The following abilities no longer ignore units classified as Ancients
          (Neutral Ancients, Warlock''s Golem, etc): Ice Vortex, Mana Void, Berserker''s

      - detail:

          \ Shadow Wave, Spirit Bear Entangle DPS, Return, Echo Stomp, Land Mine,\
          \ Suicide\_"
        - "The following are abilities that were previously getting reduced twice\
          \ as part of the attack instead of just once: Shadow Walk, Vendetta and\
          \ Meld\_"
        - 'As an example reference, here are some of the abilities that were already
          ignored by Block before: Wild Axes, Exorcism, Acid Spray, Poison Touch,
          Diabolic Edict, Quill Spray'
        note: Damage Block no longer affects physical spells (previously it affected
          some physical spells and some not)
      - detail:
        - Previously if you cast a spell and were already in range, but not facing
          the target (outside of the small cast angle), your hero would start turning,
          but not consider that turn as anything beyond normal movement from an order
          priority perspective. This meant that issuing any order while turning, during
          that very short threshold window, would not be in the order queue in the
          same way as once your casting time started.
        - It now treats your order as the same once you are in cast range.
        - The effective difference this has is that you can queue your actions in
          the same way after you click one ability without depending on the angle
          of cast being 16 degrees or 20 degrees. Previously if you issued the order
          at the wrong degree, it would completely interrupt the ability, rather than
          queuing it to do after your existing order finished as is the usual spell
          casting behavior.
        - This subtle difference applies most commonly with Blink Dagger, as you could
          easily accidentally cancel your blink order if you clicked the other ability
          before you reached the critical angle (since otherwise Blink has 0 cast
          time).
        note: Cast behavior while turning to cast has been adjusted.
      - detail:
        - "Item Silencing is called Mute.\_"
        - "Passive Disabling is called Break.\_"
        - Mute disables the ability to cast Items (in 6.83c Doom, Scepter Static Storm,
          and Hex applied this state)
        - Break disables the bonuses of passive Abilities only (in 6.83c Scepter Doom
          and Hex applied this state)
        - Previously a small portion of passive abilities were disabled by Doom and
          some others by Hex. The Break mechanic is now responsible for this behavior,
          and previous passive abilities that Hex/Doom blocked (not items, abilities)
          are included in the list of abilities Break disables.
        - "The following additional passive abilities are now added to the list of\
          \ passives disabled with Break: Aftershock, Counter Helix, Great Cleave,\
          \ Craggy Exterior, Slardar's Bash, Inner Beast, Dragon Blood, Mortal Strike,\
          \ Degen Aura, Greevil's Greed, Drunken Brawler, Feral Impulse, Shapeshift's\
          \ Critical Strike, Chaos Strike, Return, Reactive Armor, Curse of Avernus,\
          \ Natural Order, Empowering Haste, Spell Shield, Thirst, Marksmanship, Precision\

          \ Untouchable, Null Field, Gravekeeper's Cloak, Spirit Bear's Entangle and\
          \ Demolish.\_"
        - 'Additional Note: Evasion, Damage Block and Critical Strike no longer have
          special classifications on how they interact with the above. They are only
          disabled if they match the general rules of the above. For example, Butterfly''s
          evasion is not disabled when you are Hexed/Doomed (Since Break does not
          affect Items, no different than Platemail not being disabled).'
